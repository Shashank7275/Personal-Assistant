# 🤖 JARVIS Personal Assistant – Setup Guid 

---

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up and run your JARVIS Personal Assistant using Python.
Your project already contains the code — this document only covers environment setup, dependency installation, and how to launch agent.py from the console.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure:

* Python 3.10 or higher is installed
* Python is added to PATH
* Your project folder contains:

* agent.py
* requirements.txt

To verify Python:

##python --version

## Step 1 — Create Virtual Environment (.venv)

### Windows

python -m venv .venv


### Linux / Mac


python3 -m venv .venv


This creates a .venv directory.

---

## Step 2 — Activate Virtual Environment

### Windows


.venv\Scripts\activate


### Linux / Mac


source .venv/bin/activate


After activation, you should see:


(.venv)


This confirms the environment is active.

---

## Step 3 — Install Dependencies

Install all required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt


If pip needs upgrade:


pip install --upgrade pip


Then run again:


pip install -r requirements.txt


Wait until installation finishes.

---

## Step 4 — Environment Variables (.env)

If your JARVIS uses API keys (OpenAI, Google, Weather, LiveKit, etc):

Create a .env file in the root folder and add your keys there.

Make sure .env is saved before running JARVIS.

---

## Step 5 — Run JARVIS

Start the assistant:


python agent.py


You should see console output similar to:


JARVIS Activated


JARVIS is now running.

---

## Daily Usage

Each time you restart your system:

1. Open terminal in project folder
2. Activate environment

Windows:


.venv\Scripts\activate


Linux / Mac:


source .venv/bin/activate


3. Run JARVIS:


python agent.py


---

## Stop JARVIS

Press:


CTRL + C


---

## Common Issues

### Module not found

Reinstall dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

### Python not recognized

Reinstall Python and enable “Add to PATH”.

---

### Permission errors (Windows)

Run Command Prompt as Administrator.

---

## Notes

* Always activate .venv before running
* Keep agent.py in root folder
* Do not delete .venv
* Update requirements.txt when adding new libraries

## Run assistant

* Python agent.py console

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Later you can extend JARVIS with:

* Auto-start on boot
* EXE build
* GUI launcher
* Background service
* Voice wake word
* Vision / camera
* Internet search

### ✅ Setup Complete — JARVIS Ready 🤖

# 🤖 JARVIS Personal Assistant – Setup Guid brain.py


# 🎙️ LiveKit Voice Setup (JARVIS)

This section explains how to install LiveKit, connect your API inside brain.py, and resolve common *live noise cancellation errors*.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure:

* Your .venv is activated
* agent.py already runs
* You have LiveKit credentials:

From LiveKit Dashboard:

* LIVEKIT_URL
* LIVEKIT_API_KEY
* LIVEKIT_API_SECRET

---

## 📦 Step 1 — Install LiveKit Packages

With .venv active, run:


pip install livekit
pip install livekit-agents
pip install livekit-plugins-google
pip install livekit-plugins-noise-cancellation
pip install python-dotenv


Recommended extra audio deps:


pip install sounddevice pyaudio numpy


If pyaudio fails on Windows:


pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio


Then verify:


pip list | findstr livekit


You should see:

* livekit
* livekit-agents
* livekit-plugins-google
* livekit-plugins-noise-cancellation

---

## 🔐 Step 2 — Add LiveKit API Keys

Create or open .env in project root:

Put your credentials there:

* LIVEKIT_URL
* LIVEKIT_API_KEY
* LIVEKIT_API_SECRET

Save file.

Your brain.py should load these using dotenv and initialize LiveKit from there.

(Important: never hardcode keys directly in GitHub.)

---

## 🧠 Step 3 — brain.py (Voice Brain)

Inside brain.py:

* Load .env
* Initialize LiveKit client
* Create voice agent
* Import all your tools (file, window, keyboard, memory)
* Attach noise cancellation plugin

Conceptually:

brain.py =

Voice Input → LiveKit → Noise Cancellation → JARVIS Tools → Response

Make sure:

✔ brain.py imports your skill files
✔ No circular imports

If error appears, first confirm all plugins are installed (Step 1).

---

## 🔊 Step 4 — Live Noise Cancellation Error (Common Fix)

If you see errors like:

* noise_cancellation not found
* module not installed
* audio stream failed

Do this:

### 1. Reinstall plugin


pip uninstall livekit-plugins-noise-cancellation -y
pip install livekit-plugins-noise-cancellation


---

### 2. Install audio backend


pip install sounddevice pyaudio


Windows users (if pyaudio fails):


pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio


---

### 3. Restart terminal

Close terminal completely.

Reopen:

Activate env:


.venv\Scripts\activate


Run again:


python brain.py console


---

## 🔁 Step 5 — Import All Tools into brain.py

If JARVIS tools are not working with voice:

Make sure brain.py imports:

* file tools
* window control
* keyboard/mouse
* memory system

Then agent.py should only start brain.

Architecture:

agent.py → brain.py → tools

This avoids confusion.

---

## ▶️ Final Run

Always run from root:


python brain.py console


If voice works:

You’ll see mic activation + LiveKit connection.

---

## 🛑 If Still Error

Check one by one:


pip show livekit
pip show livekit-agents
pip show livekit-plugins-noise-cancellation


If missing → reinstall.

Also confirm:

* Microphone permissions allowed
* No other app using mic
* .env loaded correctly

---

## ✅ Summary

1 Activate .venv
2 Install LiveKit + plugins
3 Add API keys to .env
4 Load keys in brain.py
5 Import all tools in brain.py
6 Run python agent.py

That’s it.
